# tataboq_app - Cross-Platform Flutter App

Welcome to the tataboq_app repository! This is a simple, fun, and engaging cross-platform mobile game built with Flutter, where users test their luck by matching images.

## Game Concept:
The game is based on a simple mechanic: the player clicks on a button to "Try Your Luck," and a random image is displayed. If the image matches a predefined "winning" image, the player wins! If not, the player loses and can try again. It's a light-hearted game designed to entertain users with just one click.
